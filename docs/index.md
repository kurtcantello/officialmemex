### Summary & Key Take Aways
**

-   Galvani is famous for his experiments on frogs.
-   The investigation of electricity   
-   Laid the foundation of electricity research
-   electrophysiology 
-   This research led to eventual creation of the electric battery
-   Galvani concluded that there was intrinsic electricity in the frog
-   He prepared a frog with metallic hooks and exposed it to electricity. He did this first by using electric machines (Leyden jars, Franklin's magic squares). He eventually placed a frog on a railing that connected to a rod which was struck by lightning.
-   This created a physical reaction in the frog. (contractions)
-   Volta admired Galvani…    
-   Until his own research contradicted the findings of Galvani
-   Although Voltas experiments proved much Galvani’s wrong, he would have never make these new findings if it wasn’t for the groundwork done by Galvani 
-   Volta and Galvani continued to produce research that further extended the general knowledge of the subject.
-   With this, Volta created the first electrical battery.   
-   volta referred to the electrical battery as an ‘artificial electrical organ’
-   My interest in this article lies in the evolution of science, not in the science itself.
-   In a way, these experiments laid the groundwork for computers. 
-   Everything digital, began with electricity. 
-   The studies of Electricity kickstarter everything we see to be normal today.

### Links / Thoughts
Without ground work discoveries, evoultion could never take place. This is not lnly true in the context of this article, it is true everywhere. This is essentially the ground work for the internet. If electricity was never researched, then the internet wold never exist. 
- the evolution of the internet is a theory itself in this sense

"We may all soon be 'first-class men'": Gender and Skill in Canada's early twentieth century urban telegraph industry An article of the journal Labour/Le Travailleur Volume 27, 1991, p. 97–125 [https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/llt/1991-v27-llt_27/llt27art03/](https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/llt/1991-v27-llt_27/llt27art03/)

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   Telegraph offices in the early twentieth century employed both women and men as telegraph operators
-   This makes telegraphy an interesting case to study    
-   It was not common for men and women to work together
-   *links between gender and skill
-   The telegraph industry was based on the Morse electric telegraph
-   First successful use in 1843
-   “A wire linked two sets of instruments, forming an electrical circuit. One set of instruments might be in Montreal, the other in Winnipeg, linked by a wire string, pole by pole, across hundreds of miles”
-   Two parts
-   “Key”: hand operated lever that opened and closed the circuit. Send short bursts of current through the wire.    
-   “Sounder”: electrically operated lever that reacted from the currents sent by the “key”
-   Clicking noises were made that sent messages to the operator in morse code.
-   Gender stereotypes were very relevant in this time
-   Women were believed to have less stamina, lower wage entitlements, short working careers, short patience with the public…etc
-   In short, women were seen as less competent’
-   This industry involved branches where men and women might work together
-   For example, a press circuit 
-   Even with this evidence that women could do the same work as men, the meanings of gender at the time still prevailed.
-   Men still received higher wages and assumed superior status
-   Morse telegraphy eventually became “mens” work

### Links / Thoughts
 Even though women proved that they were capable of performing to the same standard as men, they were forced into the gender roles of the time.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   It is possible for information technologies to promote government transformation
-   Understood in 2 different ways:
-   As a transformation of internal processes    
-   As a transformation of the relationships between governments and other social and political actors (institutional transformation)
-   *theory of the co-evolution of technology, organizational networks, and institutional arrangements in the transformation of government.
-   What are the key variables and processes that facilitate government transformation through information technologies, such as government portals?
-   It is clear that the government portal is meant to satisfy the people (citizens,businesses, etc)
-   This guides the way government portals are transformed
**


--- 

### Links / Thoughts
The internet has become accepted by society. This is made clear as governments use portals in order to satisfy users/citizens. This relates to the Frankenstein article (source 5):
- people were not fond of the monster because the idea was new
- the internet was exactly the same. However over time it became accepted as the norm.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   The first internet was the global electric telegraph network established between 1835 and 1914.
-   The telegraph and the “victorian internet” have similarities’
-   Both operated by a series of codes relayed across interconnected networks
-   *Both brought lots of attention; hype. Skepticism, bewilderment….
-   The telegraph, and its evolution lead to the creation of the internet. The evolution of the telegraph had many different stages.
-   Did not jump form the first model of the telegraph to the internet
-   Governments were the first to support the creation of new communications systems
-   Telegraphy created a whole new world for business
-   Those who did not have access to the technology were at a clear disadvantage 
-   Most telegraph codes were created in the interest of the economy
-  the codes used to transmit messages were borrowed, adapted, or inspired by earlier forms of communication
-   Air and space travel would astonish Victorian time travelers, but not the internet.

### Links / Thoughts
 the telegraph had many different fazes in its upbringing which made it more and more advanced as it went along. With every shift brought more confusion and more excitement to society. 
 - this is exactly the same as the internet. With every advancement brings more confusuon, but yet more excitement and more widespread acceptance.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   Frankenstein represents a remarkable body of knowledge
-   By ignoring the human qualities that clearly make knowledge effective, particularly nurturing and caring.
-   Relevant to Galvani's experiment of electricity with the frog
-   Knowledge was a male artifact in the nineteenth-century
-   The monster, as the self conscious product of science, simply wants to change what counts as knowledge and in doing so, be counted.
-   If any constraints exist on Frankenstein's knowledge, they are social rather than supernatural. 
-   The monster represents a ‘species’ of knowledge that has not been contextualized
-   The monster was created out of the curiosity of the scientist, not for the good of society.
-   Because of this, society rejects the idea of it.

### Links / Thoughts
the monster represents the internet.
- because it is new, it is unaccepted by society
- however, it contains so much in whch the people could dicover.




ATOMIC NOTES

title: How everything connects...
Thoughts
---
After analyzing all of my sources, there is one recurring theme. Everything that becomes something  large (in our case, the internet), goes through stages. 
- It becomes something new and unaccepted by society (the monster)
- then it is forced on to society (Galvani's frog experiment)
- only certain people have access, or accept it (the telegraph)
- it becomes publicly accepted and the new norm (the internet)

LECTURE NOTES

Archaeology (or the theoretical framework for this class)

-   We need archaeology not just because of the things of this history we want to explore, but also because of the places of this history
    

-   The happenings of the past are just as relevant as the ones yet to come. They set the groundwork for what we newly discover.
    

  

-   Theory is a framework for understanding the world & directing your attention
    

-   What's important?
    
-   What questions do we have?
    

  

-   Complicated vs complex
    

-   A rocket ship verse the queensway
    
-   Recall in class wave example
    

-   You knew to raise arms when the person beside you did so
    

  

-   Assemblage theory
    
-   Atgencement, things come together
    

-   Meaning depends on context
    

-   Both internal,within
    
-   External, in time
    
-   External, in space
    
-   Nothing is meaningful on its own
    

-   This relates to the history of the internet because many different things relate to each other. Everything the internet did impacted humanity, and everything humanity did impacted the internet. 
    

  

-   The world can not be divided into physical objects/properties and human agency
    
-   It's the interaction between human and object that matters
    

-   Humans interact with their social medias every day
    
-   Material engagement theory



Codes & Ciphers

-   Cryptology: systems for ‘secret’ writing
    
-   Cryptanalysis: system for revealing those secrets
    

-   This is relevant in social life as well. In order to have privacy in any regard, you need a way to keep those private things to yourself.
    

  

-   A code: ‘variable sized elements that have meaning in the plaintext language’ - syllables, words, phrases (Dooley, 5); thousands of substitutions
    
-   A cipher: a transformation from plaintext according to some transformation (Dooley, 5-6); ‘small fixed number of substitution elements’
    

  

-   Nomenclators
    

-   Mixture of substitution cyphers and codebooks
    
-   Still susceptible to frequency analysis and context-dependent guessing
    

  

-   When analyzing history.. Think about where the gaps are
    

-   This is where new research comes in
    

-   Where are the women?
    
-   Who/What is left out?
    
-   What other things had to have happened to support all this?



Electric History

-    Lots of animals make electricity 
    
-   Until 18th century, electricity was nothing more than curiosity 
    
-   Looking for contrast between electricity and soul
    
-   Electricity was discovered in frogs (animal bodies) :galvonism
    
-   The vital force is in the body
    

-   Use human corpses for experiment 
    

  

-   On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was actually opened
    
-   In the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion. Mr Pass, the beadle of the surgeons company, who was officially present during this experiment, was so alarmed that he died of fright 
    

-   What were the ancient Greeks up to?
    
-   Amber in ancient greek is “elektron”
    
-   People ask what is this stuff? (electricity: shocks)
    

  

-   Connection between electricity and life
    

  

-   Leyden jar
    

-   Stores static electricity
    

  

-   200 monks stand in a circle with metal rods.
    
-   One holds leyden jar
    
-   Shocks them all instantly 
    

-   Concludes electricity travels instantaneously 
    

  

-   Ben frank learns lightning and electricity is the same thing
    

-   Lighting directors (rods) on buildings derived from kite experiment 
    

  

-   Batteries
    

-   Came from experiment which stacked metal and wet cloth 
    

  

-   Scholarly literature began with guys meeting once a month to share ideas
    

-   “The lunatics”
    

  

-   Electricity and magnets
    
-   Hans Chrisitan Orsted - works out that electric current in a nearby wire will deflect a compass needle; he works out that electric current produces a circular magnetic field
    
-   Michael Faraday - works out how to go the other way, that you could use a magnet to induce electricity
    
-   Joseph Henry - inventor of many electrical devices, including the relay
    

-   There was so much electricity in the air, as it were, that all of these things were being discovered by multiple people at much the same time
    

  

-   Michael henry built the relay
    

-   A mile long wire in which he sent electricity through and rung a bell after
    
-   Collapse of space time 
    

  

-   Telegraphs
    

-   You can't just string up a wire from A to B
    
-   Gotta think in circuits and take into account how to make that juice flow
    
-   One Henry - and others - solved that, messages at a distance are now feasible
    
-   Just in time too: first steam-powered railways open in the 1830s



Mediums & Messages

-   ‘Medium’ is something that carries something else
    

-   Carrying information. Social media, newspapers, movies, speeches etc…
    

  

-   Who decides that something is important?
    

-   In relation to the modern day internet, it is big media industries. They control the algorithms, which effectively control the public sphere.
    

  

-   “Classifications both reflect and direct our thinking. The way we order represents the way we think’
    

-   Stephen Jay Gould, ‘The Titular Bishop of Titiopolis’, Natural History 90: 22 1981
    

  

-   The medium holds just as much importance as the message
    

-   The way something is interpreted is impacted not just by the message, but how it is delivered.
    
-   Breaking up with someone over text is more rude than over a phone call. Breaking up with someone over a phone call is more rude than breaking up with them in person.
    

-   The way we classify media/messages has implications for power, control, and discipline (reflects and directs our thinking)
    

  

-   Libraries reflect the world back to itself
    

-   The way the world is interpreted by humans is captured in academic literacy.
    

-   “Books inspire other books written in the future, and cite books written in the past” - Pratchett
    

  

-   Bidirectional link
    

-   Two way connection
    

  

-   We try to find a correct way to organize information, but all this does is reflect what how we already see the world
    

-   Serendipity: a function of a particular vision of the world, a reproduction of its norms
    

-   The digitization of knowledge is built by people for whom these categorizations/classifications of the world are normalized
    

-   This is now the norm. The future is digital, and nobody denies it.
    

  

-   As the internet continues to evolve, shifts in what we believe to be normal will continue to happen. Power distribution will continue to change along with it.
