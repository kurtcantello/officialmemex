Title:  "A symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits," in Electrical Engineering

Title: **Customer Acceptance of Online Banking in Developing Economies**

Title: **The role of big data analytics in industrial Internet of Things**

**In the grand scheme of things, the Internet as we know it today, evolved from the earliest form of electrical science. This form of electrical science is Electrophysiology. Luigi Galvani and Marco Piccolino used their creations (Leyden jars, Franklin’s magic squares) to send shocks through frogs. Galvani would stab metallic hooks through the frog, and expose it to electricity. This laid the foundation for electrical research. Without this research, the first internet would have never been created. The first internet in this case is the “victorian internet”. This internet was not what we know the internet to be today, instead, it was the first ever telegraph. The needle lodestone telegraph, established in 1835 and 1914, operated by a series of codes relates across interconnected networks. This development removed the travel between communication. When you once had to travel by horseback to deliver a note, you could now send a message across the same distance using the telegraph. Governments were the first to support the creation of the new communication system, which was the beginning of government control over information. If this basic level of technology was never created, then relay and switching circuits could not exist. These circuits are the base of how literally all modern technology operates. A tv can not be turned on if the plug is not plugged in, a laptop can not connect to the internet if the wifi router is not plugged in, etc. Already, we can see how sending electric shocks through a frog, was the beginning of literally all modern technology. Eventually, as we know, the internet made massive advancements in a short period of time. Unsurprisingly, these advancements were quick to gain acceptance as they offered convenience. For example, as outlined by Tahir Qureshi, when online banking began in the 1990s it did not take long for people to see its utility. Beginning with businesses, eventually, everyone began to do their banking from the comfort of their home. Once the internet gained widespread acceptance, it did not take long for big industries to take advantage. With the internet, big data collection evolved alongside it. This data allows industries to target ads to incredibly specific groups of people. But there are also issues that come with big data collection. How much information should these industries really have about users of the internet?**


I did not feel like I got what I wanted out of this class. In the beginning I said that I wante to better understand where the real motivation came from that drove the development of the internet (who really served to benefit). I do not believe this was covered, or that much about the actual internet was covered in general. Yes, we learned about the electrical evolution, but the interent is a thing of it's own, and is far more complex than what we covered. In my opinion, the internet did not begin with the telegraph, it began with the first user on a web browser. This is what I was expecting to learn about. I would have liked to learn about how the internet went from the first web browser, to the dominant public sphere. Nowadays, the internet is where decisions are made that impact the direction of government and society. This is where my interest is. I also struggled greatly not because I wasn't following along with the content, but because the way this course was designed does not align with the university standard. It is not reasonable to expect students to learn all of these programs on top of compete the material. I am a tech savy person, and although I followed along with everything, I still had issues, and this impacts my grade. I understand that you wanted students to reach out, but I am a 3rd year student, this is an elective for me, and I work a fulltime job. I do not have the time to figure out all these little conjuctions. Grades should be based on content, and in the future, the details of this course should be outlined in it's description. It is not fair to expect students to either learn 5 new programs, or drop the class. Never have a taken a course that neglected all the basic foundations of all other university courses. Now, I am going to get a subpar grade on my transcript because I struggled to properly format my github website when submitting a normal essay with the same information would have achieved the exact same thing for you.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**

-   Galvani is famous for his experiments on frogs.
-   The investigation of electricity   
-   Laid the foundation of electricity research
-   electrophysiology 
-   This research led to eventual creation of the electric battery
-   Galvani concluded that there was intrinsic electricity in the frog
-   He prepared a frog with metallic hooks and exposed it to electricity. He did this first by using electric machines (Leyden jars, Franklin's magic squares). He eventually placed a frog on a railing that connected to a rod which was struck by lightning.
-   This created a physical reaction in the frog. (contractions)
-   Volta admired Galvani…    
-   Until his own research contradicted the findings of Galvani
-   Although Voltas experiments proved much Galvani’s wrong, he would have never make these new findings if it wasn’t for the groundwork done by Galvani 
-   Volta and Galvani continued to produce research that further extended the general knowledge of the subject.
-   With this, Volta created the first electrical battery.   
-   volta referred to the electrical battery as an ‘artificial electrical organ’
-   My interest in this article lies in the evolution of science, not in the science itself.
-   In a way, these experiments laid the groundwork for computers. 
-   Everything digital, began with electricity. 
-   The studies of Electricity kickstarter everything we see to be normal today.

### Links / Thoughts
Without ground work discoveries, evoultion could never take place. This is not lnly true in the context of this article, it is true everywhere. This is essentially the ground work for the internet. If electricity was never researched, then the internet wold never exist. 
- the evolution of the internet is a theory itself in this sense

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   Telegraph offices in the early twentieth century employed both women and men as telegraph operators
-   This makes telegraphy an interesting case to study    
-   It was not common for men and women to work together
-   *links between gender and skill
-   The telegraph industry was based on the Morse electric telegraph
-   First successful use in 1843
-   “A wire linked two sets of instruments, forming an electrical circuit. One set of instruments might be in Montreal, the other in Winnipeg, linked by a wire string, pole by pole, across hundreds of miles”
-   Two parts
-   “Key”: hand operated lever that opened and closed the circuit. Send short bursts of current through the wire.    
-   “Sounder”: electrically operated lever that reacted from the currents sent by the “key”
-   Clicking noises were made that sent messages to the operator in morse code.
-   Gender stereotypes were very relevant in this time
-   Women were believed to have less stamina, lower wage entitlements, short working careers, short patience with the public…etc
-   In short, women were seen as less competent’
-   This industry involved branches where men and women might work together
-   For example, a press circuit 
-   Even with this evidence that women could do the same work as men, the meanings of gender at the time still prevailed.
-   Men still received higher wages and assumed superior status
-   Morse telegraphy eventually became “mens” work
**

### Links / Thoughts
 Even though women proved that they were capable of performing to the same standard as men, they were forced into the gender roles of the time.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   It is possible for information technologies to promote government transformation
-   Understood in 2 different ways:
-   As a transformation of internal processes    
-   As a transformation of the relationships between governments and other social and political actors (institutional transformation)
-   *theory of the co-evolution of technology, organizational networks, and institutional arrangements in the transformation of government.
-   What are the key variables and processes that facilitate government transformation through information technologies, such as government portals?
-   It is clear that the government portal is meant to satisfy the people (citizens,businesses, etc)
-   This guides the way government portals are transformed
**


--- 

### Links / Thoughts
The internet has become accepted by society. This is made clear as governments use portals in order to satisfy users/citizens. This relates to the Frankenstein article (source 5):
- people were not fond of the monster because the idea was new
- the internet was exactly the same. However over time it became accepted as the norm.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   The first internet was the global electric telegraph network established between 1835 and 1914.
-   The telegraph and the “victorian internet” have similarities’
-   Both operated by a series of codes relayed across interconnected networks
-   *Both brought lots of attention; hype. Skepticism, bewilderment….
-   The telegraph, and its evolution lead to the creation of the internet. The evolution of the telegraph had many different stages.
-   Did not jump form the first model of the telegraph to the internet
-   Governments were the first to support the creation of new communications systems
-   Telegraphy created a whole new world for business
-   Those who did not have access to the technology were at a clear disadvantage 
-   Most telegraph codes were created in the interest of the economy
-  the codes used to transmit messages were borrowed, adapted, or inspired by earlier forms of communication
-   Air and space travel would astonish Victorian time travelers, but not the internet.
**


--- 

### Links / Thoughts
 the telegraph had many different fazes in its upbringing which made it more and more advanced as it went along. With every shift brought more confusion and more excitement to society. 
 - this is exactly the same as the internet. With every advancement brings more confusuon, but yet more excitement and more widespread acceptance.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   Frankenstein represents a remarkable body of knowledge
-   By ignoring the human qualities that clearly make knowledge effective, particularly nurturing and caring.
-   Relevant to Galvani's experiment of electricity with the frog
-   Knowledge was a male artifact in the nineteenth-century
-   The monster, as the self conscious product of science, simply wants to change what counts as knowledge and in doing so, be counted.
-   If any constraints exist on Frankenstein's knowledge, they are social rather than supernatural. 
-   The monster represents a ‘species’ of knowledge that has not been contextualized
-   The monster was created out of the curiosity of the scientist, not for the good of society.
-   Because of this, society rejects the idea of it.
**

### Links / Thoughts
the monster represents the internet.
- because it is new, it is unaccepted by society
- however, it contains so much in whch the people could dicover.




ATOMIC NOTES

title: How everything connects...
Thoughts
---
After analyzing all of my sources, there is one recurring theme. Everything that becomes something  large (in our case, the internet), goes through stages. 
- It becomes something new and unaccepted by society (the monster)
- then it is forced on to society (Galvani's frog experiment)
- only certain people have access, or accept it (the telegraph)
- it becomes publicly accepted and the new norm (the internet)

LECTURE NOTES

Archaeology (or the theoretical framework for this class)

-   We need archaeology not just because of the things of this history we want to explore, but also because of the places of this history
    

-   The happenings of the past are just as relevant as the ones yet to come. They set the groundwork for what we newly discover.
    

  

-   Theory is a framework for understanding the world & directing your attention
    

-   What's important?
    
-   What questions do we have?
    

  

-   Complicated vs complex
    

-   A rocket ship verse the queensway
    
-   Recall in class wave example
    

-   You knew to raise arms when the person beside you did so
    

  

-   Assemblage theory
    
-   Atgencement, things come together
    

-   Meaning depends on context
    

-   Both internal,within
    
-   External, in time
    
-   External, in space
    
-   Nothing is meaningful on its own
    

-   This relates to the history of the internet because many different things relate to each other. Everything the internet did impacted humanity, and everything humanity did impacted the internet. 
    

  

-   The world can not be divided into physical objects/properties and human agency
    
-   It's the interaction between human and object that matters
    

-   Humans interact with their social medias every day
    
-   Material engagement theory



Codes & Ciphers

-   Cryptology: systems for ‘secret’ writing
    
-   Cryptanalysis: system for revealing those secrets
    

-   This is relevant in social life as well. In order to have privacy in any regard, you need a way to keep those private things to yourself.
    

  

-   A code: ‘variable sized elements that have meaning in the plaintext language’ - syllables, words, phrases (Dooley, 5); thousands of substitutions
    
-   A cipher: a transformation from plaintext according to some transformation (Dooley, 5-6); ‘small fixed number of substitution elements’
-   
    

  

-   Nomenclators
    

-   Mixture of substitution cyphers and codebooks
    
-   Still susceptible to frequency analysis and context-dependent guessing
    

  

-   When analyzing history.. Think about where the gaps are
    

-   This is where new research comes in
    

-   Where are the women?
    
-   Who/What is left out?
    
-   What other things had to have happened to support all this?



Electric History

-    Lots of animals make electricity 
    
-   Until 18th century, electricity was nothing more than curiosity 
    
-   Looking for contrast between electricity and soul
    
-   Electricity was discovered in frogs (animal bodies) :galvonism
    
-   The vital force is in the body
    

-   Use human corpses for experiment 
    

  

-   On the first application of the process to the face, the jaws of the deceased criminal began to quiver, and the adjoining muscles were horribly contorted, and one eye was actually opened
    
-   In the subsequent part of the process the right hand was raised and clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion. Mr Pass, the beadle of the surgeons company, who was officially present during this experiment, was so alarmed that he died of fright 
    

-   What were the ancient Greeks up to?
    
-   Amber in ancient greek is “elektron”
    
-   People ask what is this stuff? (electricity: shocks)
    

  

-   Connection between electricity and life
    

  

-   Leyden jar
    

-   Stores static electricity
    

  

-   200 monks stand in a circle with metal rods.
    
-   One holds leyden jar
    
-   Shocks them all instantly 
    

-   Concludes electricity travels instantaneously 
    

  

-   Ben frank learns lightning and electricity is the same thing
    

-   Lighting directors (rods) on buildings derived from kite experiment 
    

  

-   Batteries
    

-   Came from experiment which stacked metal and wet cloth 
    

  

-   Scholarly literature began with guys meeting once a month to share ideas
    

-   “The lunatics”
    

  

-   Electricity and magnets
    
-   Hans Chrisitan Orsted - works out that electric current in a nearby wire will deflect a compass needle; he works out that electric current produces a circular magnetic field
    
-   Michael Faraday - works out how to go the other way, that you could use a magnet to induce electricity
    
-   Joseph Henry - inventor of many electrical devices, including the relay
    

-   There was so much electricity in the air, as it were, that all of these things were being discovered by multiple people at much the same time
    

  

-   Michael henry built the relay
    

-   A mile long wire in which he sent electricity through and rung a bell after
    
-   Collapse of space time 
    

  

-   Telegraphs
    

-   You can't just string up a wire from A to B
    
-   Gotta think in circuits and take into account how to make that juice flow
    
-   One Henry - and others - solved that, messages at a distance are now feasible
    
-   Just in time too: first steam-powered railways open in the 1830s



Mediums & Messages

-   ‘Medium’ is something that carries something else
    

-   Carrying information. Social media, newspapers, movies, speeches etc…
    

  

-   Who decides that something is important?
    

-   In relation to the modern day internet, it is big media industries. They control the algorithms, which effectively control the public sphere.
    

  

-   “Classifications both reflect and direct our thinking. The way we order represents the way we think’
    

-   Stephen Jay Gould, ‘The Titular Bishop of Titiopolis’, Natural History 90: 22 1981
    

  

-   The medium holds just as much importance as the message
    

-   The way something is interpreted is impacted not just by the message, but how it is delivered.
    
-   Breaking up with someone over text is more rude than over a phone call. Breaking up with someone over a phone call is more rude than breaking up with them in person.
    

-   The way we classify media/messages has implications for power, control, and discipline (reflects and directs our thinking)
    

  

-   Libraries reflect the world back to itself
    

-   The way the world is interpreted by humans is captured in academic literacy.
    

-   “Books inspire other books written in the future, and cite books written in the past” - Pratchett
    

  

-   Bidirectional link
    

-   Two way connection
    

  

-   We try to find a correct way to organize information, but all this does is reflect what how we already see the world
    

-   Serendipity: a function of a particular vision of the world, a reproduction of its norms
    

-   The digitization of knowledge is built by people for whom these categorizations/classifications of the world are normalized
    

-   This is now the norm. The future is digital, and nobody denies it.
    

  

-   As the internet continues to evolve, shifts in what we believe to be normal will continue to happen. Power distribution will continue to change along with it.

- Alexander von Humbolt conducted extensive studies in the 1790s on “animal electricity and metallic electricity)
He did studies on electric eels in SOuth America and would often use his body in the experiments 

- He headed to paris in 1768 and visited museums, scientific meetings, met with leading french scientists, and was asked to advise an Academie commission investigating galvanism
- Humboldt and Bonpland hiked for six weeks from the Mediterranean Coast across the Pyrenees Mountains to continue their study
- They persuaded S[anish King Charles to let them explore in the American territories
- He was told he would have to pay his own expenses but still inform New Spain of his findings for how they could best exploit its mines and other riches
- He said the framework for his research endeavors will be “the harmony of concurrent forces, and the influence of inanimate world on animal and vegetal life” (trans, from Hamy, 1905, p. 18)
- He brought with him a number of electrical instruments “I had brought with me electrometers mounted with straw, pith-balls, and gold-leaf; also a small leyden jar which could be charged by friction”
- He brought these instruments to study the so-called “electric eels” inspired by his extensive galvanic research in Europe
- He tests his instruments and the eels defend themselves from the electricity whereas the horses sank beneath the water and died
- March 19, 1800, Humbolt began his research on the eels at Cano de Bera. One year after his return to Europe he published his findings in various scientific journals.

- Humbolt found that eels shocking organs are large and take up two thirds of their body

“The political unity of India, more consolidated, and extending farther than it ever did under the Great Moguls, was the first condition of its regeneration. That unity, imposed by the British sword, will now be strengthened and perpetuated by the electric telegraph/” - Karl Marx, 1853
For most of human history the speed of communication relied on physical transportation
This impacted social, political, and economic factors
Impacted wars. Messages took a long time to be received.

The European powers grew due to the improvements in their communications technology
They could send military messages much faster than those who relied on a physical messenger

This utility began to be recognized
This sparked the necessity of the telegraph, everyone needed its technology to be a competitor

### Links / Thoughts
The telegraph became a necessity for the survival of colonies. Just like today, if you do not keep up with technological evolution, you will be left behind. For example, Countries who do not keep up with new technology in their military are not respected.

### Summary & Key Take Aways

Modern technology is reliant on relay contacts and switches
This all began with the telegraph

The circuit between two terminals must be open or closed at all times
This applies to literally all modern technology

I am not a mathematician, so a lot of this article was difficult for me to understand, but it was clear that all technology is reliant on circuits, and every circuit can be mathematically dissected making every move predictable.

Just like how a telegraph needs two ends to be working with each other, so does all modern tech. For example, a tv only turns on if the cord is plugged in

Something as simple as a ciruit that open and closed at all times created the evolution of all technology. It is amazing because we can prdict everything with methematics.

Ada is a programming language for military computer systems
Was made in the late 1970s by a French computer scientists under contract to the United States Defense Department
The language is now used in nuclear power plants, medical devices, air traffic control etc.

The book is written in black and white images. Babbage's machine is a large contraption. Nothing like a computer now.

The book then goes into a fictional story in what is called the “Pocket Universe”

At one point this was fictional, now we actually do this

This was an interesting read as what was once seen as a futuristic fiction, is now a reality.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**

 
From the days of the Roman Empire to the start of the nineteenth century, methods of communication made little progress
Speed of information was restricted to the speed of a horse or a sailboat
For example, it took 2 months for the news of Nelson’s sensational victory at the Battle of the Nile to reach London un 1798
Another example, in 1812, a message was sent by way of boat from England to the US to inform them that they would no longer interfere with American shipping. The US declared war before the not arrived resulting in the deaths of thousands of soldiers

Not only was slow communication impacting the military, it also impacted economic and social activity. 
For example, newspapers were publishing news that was actually months old

The first practical telegraph system in the 1830s was the start of resolving these issues
The telegraph was the building block for telephone networks.
Telephone networks were the building blocks for the internet

The telegraph is the reason all modern technology exists. Simple arrangements of wire and mechanical switches evolved into television, social networking, podcasting, and the World WIde Web.
The doorbell evolved from the telegraph. The television evolved from the doorbell.

After analyziong all of sources, my thoughts were very eye opening. For example, big tech industries would not exists if somebody did not travell across the world to test electric eels and survive to publish the findings. The evolution of modern technology begins at the very start of electricity. Nothing can exists without something coming before it. The telegraph is responsible for all fast communications, which involves the internet. If we never found out how to make a electric doorbell work, we would never have AI.

LECTURE NOTES + THOUGHTS SUBMISSION 2


February 13: The first internet: the telegraph

Assemblages of technologies exist in many fields
Complex systems can be viewed as assemblies
It is possible for complex systems to evolve under the right conditions
How should the right conditions be met? What made the electrical telegraph more successful?
What did it teach us about electricity-powered networks?
In order to do that, we need a framework for identifying the story's why.
We inquire to understand why history exists; history is a verb

The telegraph was the start of all modern technology. 

Supervening Social Necessity
All the pieces were in place
Especially the creation of the galvanometer
The emergence of the railroad provides the necessity that the Admiralty’s blinkered view could not 
First passenger railway Stockton-Darlington in UK, 1825

Even the railroad evolved from the telegraph. The creation of a circuit where electricity is sent from one end to another is central to all things technology (which began with the telegraph).


February 15: Moar! Telegraph



The stock market
Viral texts

Multiple services emerge; Multiplelawsuits
Henry O’Reilly in the western US; secures right to exploit Morse Patents; Morse later regrets this
Cooke and Wheatstone have american patents prior to Morse
Alexander Bain, ‘Chemical telegraph’ (1843, similar in concept to Davy’s)
Competing services, technologies stringing lines side-by-side (as between Boston andWashington, New York and Buffalo)
Eventually Morse is triumphant in the courts
Extending the Wires
All those court battles; also vandalism, cutting of lines
By 1851, Morse triumphant! Consolidation of lines in US
Only three companies still standing
By the end of 1860s only Western union still standing
> 150 companies absorbed
37380 miles of cable
2250 telegraph offices

In this sense, the telegraph also created big tech industries and all the issues that can come with that lol.

“ We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Main to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing to communicate “ - Thoreau
Individual states begin to realize that controls of international communications matters
Britain especially advantaged: control of gutta pecha, colonies around the world to control start/end of long distant lines
1875 President Grant explains why a French cable company was denied permission to land a cable in the US: they gotta let us use their cable in return.
Implications for colonialism
Takes about 100 days to sail from London to Hong Kong
Marx & Engels 1848: “The need of a constantly expanding market for its product chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.”
If distance is collapsed
If messages can be transmitted thousands of miles within seconds/minutes
Then what is to stop a state from expanding its reach? 
(you can play with the concept of space/time in the context of the Roman World with ORBIS)
Resinous -tree-gum that can be crafted in a plastic/rubbery way
Without Gutta-Percha, there is no trans-atlantic cable. There is no long distance telegraphy.
By early 20th century, there were 200 000 miles of undersea cable; GP about 27 000 tons; that means 88 million trees destroyed




March 1st: how business shenanigans gives rise to information theory

By the end of the 19th century, ‘networks’ were not a novel idea

Bell:
“In a similar manner, it is conceivable hat cables of telephone wires could be laid underground, or suspended overhead, communicating by branch wires with private dwellings, country houses, shops, manufactories… unting them through the main cable with a central office where the wires could be connected as desired, establishing direct communication between any two places… I believe, in the future, wires will unite the head offices of the telephone company in different cities, and a man …may communicate by word of mouth with another in a distant place. (prospectus for prospective investors)
First bell company founded in 1875
First telephone exchange operated by Western Union’s telephone subsidiary
First woman central office operator: 1878, Emma Nutt
Idea of assigning unique numbers to subscribers suggested in 1879


“National Bell” becomes ‘American Bell”
Upshot:
Hubbard & Bell are out
Theodore Vail remains
The agreement with Western Union still in force

As mentioned, the telegraph was the birth of big tech. All issues related to big tech (information leaks, public opinion control etc) all goes back to the creation of the telegraph.


Which breaks the agreement
1884 American Bell established a long distance line between NY & Boston.
Creates a subsidiary company to do this: American Telephone & Telegraph Company 
Establishes a laboratory to improve long distance telephony 
1888- all curts battles around the original patents are won by Bell
Bell is making money hand over fist, even though rest of economy is in depression
Too bad the patents just won were about to expire
Independents appear; Bell fights them with both legitimate & spurious court cases
Cuts rates ridiculously where there is competition
Refuses to interconnect to other systems
Buys up stocks of competitors

Long distance telephony was central to Bell’s plan to survive the expiration of its patents
Seemed also that Bell was directing customers to use telegraph services that it owned/had major stake in
Antitrust legislation, populist politicians, interstate commerce commission: AT&T in the crosshairs

The telegraph created a battle for control of information.

information theory

Claude Shannon in 1948 took this idea to its logical conclusion and developed a way to think about a message as being composed of two things:
The content
The information 
‘Information’ is a measurement of the redundancy of that content, or how ‘surprising’ the next letter/sound/wave/is.

Information theory is still very relevant today.

March 6: Digital, Electronic Computers: Competences & Social Necessities 

Competences



The turing machine

Shannon again & telephone relays/exchanges
Combine information theory with Turing’s ‘universal computer’ and you have a way for a machine computer to simulate any of the work a human computer could do.

Parallel kinds of ‘computing’ devices - the analogue simulators
Kelvins tide calculator for different points around the world
Kelvin proposes in 1876 a way of linking several similar devices together physically to simulate differential equations
The mechanisms to achieve this not developed until the 1920s… and Vennevar Bush

‘programming’ these machines:
Literally bashing them into different shapes with hammers and wrenches
Useful for scientific analysis

Modern technology began with what we would now consider utter foolishness


Howard Aitken
Prof at Harvard. Had designed his own electromechanical calculator to help with his thesis work; proposes the machine to the military in 1937; military says nah, though its own renewing engineer wanted it; engineer introduces Aitken to IBM & Thomas Watson (president)

Existing ‘social necessity’ good enough for electromechanical calculators, not enough for all-purpose general computers

Ballistics
The industrialization of war over the 19th century - new types of guns (e.g. field guns - cannons etc), new types of firepower
Reverend Francis Bashforth, 1864-1880 - experiments related to air dag and velocity -produces the first firing tables
US military, in aftermath of civil war, establishes testing range to trai ballistic officers and work out tables for different kinds of guns

Programming - Competences

We’re now in the period of digital incunabula
The missing supervening social necessity? Nuclear war

For humans to fully uncover the capabilities of modern technology, it needs to be experimented in every aspect. This includes war which would be nuclear in present time

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
BASED IN 1990s

Rapid tech advancements have introduced major changes in the worldwide economic and business atmosphere
Banking sector can attribute tech for sped up communication and transactions

In this study, the customer acceptance of online banking in Pakistan is evaluated

The pakistan banking sector has done amazing do the evolution of tech in the banking system. Has caused a competitive atmosphere.

Online banking is the most recent delivery channel introduced by mainstream banking and causes competition as every bank needs to have optimal online banking to keep up with the competition.
A bank can no longer survive without online banking

It is expected that 60% of retail banking dealings will be online in ten years’ time

Due to the time saving nature of onlinebanking, customer acceptance has not been an issue.

The intention of this paper is to evaluate the factors that manipulate the nature of customers towards online banking and their growing tendency towards the online financial institutions.

Customer acceptance is strongly contributed to the perceived usefulness of online banking
Customer acceptance also contributed to the safety and privacy that online banking delivers.

In Pakistan, almost 50% of the customers shifted from traditional banking to online banking.

Humans crave convenience. This is the reason the internet has gotten to the point it is at today, it has made virtually everything more convenient. Now, you don’t need to even leave your house to do your banking. This need for convenience began with the telegraph. It made it more convenient to communicate, and this ideology bled into all other aspects of the digital world.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
In the 1990s leading experts, politicians, public officials, business leaders and journalists predicted that the internet would transform the world. The 
This would change everything from the way business is run to way democracy is organized and information is shared

Very quickly it was absurd to assume someone could live entirely offline. Passive consumption became active participation

Some predictions did not come true
It was predicted that the internet would lead to the undermining of dictators. This proved to be incorrect.

Some people were still very skeptical. Skepticisms included that internet usage was taking away from personal relationships and that it did not actually re-shape the world like others said it was doing even though it was seemingly doing exactly that.

A lot of claims were incorrect though. In the 1990s it was widely claimed that the internet would generate wealth and prosperity for all. This did not happen, it only made the rich richer.

Although not everyone got rich, the internet did create a new economy. This created more predictions that all earlier predictions haven't come true simply because they were premature and they are yet to come true.

The internet changed interactions between suppliers, producers and consumers.
Effectively changing the economy
Resulted in big companies dominance and control of information (e.g. google)


**


--- 

### Links / Thoughts
Perhaps the truth in all of these predictions lies somewhere in the middle of it all. Shoot for the moon and land on the stars type of thing. The internet has certainly changed the way the economy and society functions as a whole. But some of these predictions have only become partly true. For example, it was predicted that the internet would make everyone rich. This did not happen, but the internet did make a lot more people rich as it presented uncountable new ways to make money. It was predicted that the internet would essentially abolish communism, this hasn't been true but it has had a similar effect. The internet makes it much harder for these leaders to control their people, so perhaps in the future, the internet will make it impossible for communism to exist.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
Hypertext is a non-sequential writing: a node contains some amount of text or other information. The nodes are connected by directed links

People often get lost in navigating these hypertexts 
They are bi-directional
left/right or in/out

A solution for this is helping users recognize their present location
Overview diagrams have been used as navigational aids
This system used two levels of overview diagrams tro provide users with both a coarse-grained sense of location in the local neighborhood of the current node. This approach works well in the current system which is fairly small, since its information space is divided into only 95 screens containing text which took just 9 pages

Videotex systems showed that the backtrack facility was one of the most important navigation facilities, especially for novice users.
Users use backtrack when they are in a situation they can not handle

Timestamps stamp movements between users' screens. When a user returns to a location in the hypertext, the system displays the time which has passed since that user's previous visit to that location.

Footprints use check marks to serve as footprints on the overview diagrams, indicating where the user has been.

The amount the internet has evolved in such a short amount of time is incredible. Not that long ago people were struggling to navigate it as this article outlines. This connects to Curran James' article about the predictions people made for the internet because it is evolving so fast. Some of those predictions may not be incorrect, it may just be the case that they haven’t come true yet.

The industrial internet of things (IIOT) is currently attributed as the fourth industrial revolution 

The internet of things
Cyber-physical systems
Cloud computing
Automation
Wireless techs
AR
Concentric computing
Etc

Big data in IIOT systems emerge from a plethora of technologies

IoT devices in IIOT systems refer to devices that can remotely sense and actuate in industrial environments
The on-board sensing facilities in IoT devices lead the generation of big data.
Teye result in massive back-end cloud service utilization for the execution of BDA processes.

BDA processes are executed as a result of multistage highly interdependent application components 

Big data emerges in raw form with large volume and enormous speed, and data scientists spend 70%-80% of their time in data preparation activities. 

A common example of IIOT systems is the concept of a smart factor system (SFS)
Key attributes:
Self-awareness
Self organization
Self0 Maintenance
Self-prediction
Self-configuration
And self-comparison

The vision of the future industries to connect manufacturing systems with distributors and consumers can only be achieved by adopting IIOT and BDA processes as core components for value creation.
Adoption of BDA in IIOT systems is still in its early stage. 
Currency bDA systems provide generic frameworks for data engineering, preparation and analysis, however, considerable efforts are required to alter existing BDA processes to meet the demands of IIOT systems.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
Market for price information is controlled by a gatekeeper
So is the homogenous market it serves

The gatekeeper charges fees to firms that advertise prices on its internet site and to consumers who access the list of advertised prices

How gatekeepers make profit
The product market exhibits price dispersion
Access fees at sufficiently low that all consumers subscribe
Advertising fees exceed especially optimal levels which leads to partial firm participation
Advertised prices are below unadvertised prices.

This article connects directly with Muhammed Rehmans. Money controls everything. Every aspect of the internet exists so someone else can profit. These gatekeepers take advantage of everything they can to get money out of the information flowing on the internet.

Thoughts

After analyzing my additional sources, one theme kept coming to mind. Everthing is driven by money.

Once the internet was created, every advancement served to benefit somebody other than the everyday user. The people that serve to benefit the most are the gatekeeprs that control the flow of information. From the development of the telegraph, to the most recent development of AI technology, somebody other than the everyday user has benefited greatly. This leaves me with a confusing head space at the end of the course. I feel as if the entire advancement of the internet was designed in some way to further push capitalsim.

LECTURE NOTES + THOUGHTS SUBMISSION 3

March 13: Is it time for the internet yet?

Info theory allows us to separate the meaning of a message from its ‘information’, the measure of its redundancy, hence, the amount of damage it can take and still be understood.
Without that insight, nothing else can work. It’s what makes digital communications work.

“When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass. It can only be in one place… The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the nxt that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.”

Timesharing
Technique for using the speed of the computer to present the appearance of multiple simultaneous users
Terminal - a keyboard/teletype/whatever for

Packet switching
Developed independently in US, and in UK, at the same time
Only one of these was framed in the context of surviving nuclear war

US Political Context
Paul Baran engineer at the Rand COrporation begins thinking about secure communications
Baran’s original system was the simplest system: go/no go , nuke or no nuke

Controlling data flow
“Message switching”
And telephone switches used information theory to figure out least congested routes to wire a circuit

IBM 2741, ca 1965
A direct connection in adjacent rooms at first
Then local phone lines
But long distance rates interfere
High cost of communication makes users work fast. WHich undermines purpose of timesharing

Davus unveils packet switching in 1966 at a conference
Learns form a British military officer afterwards that it's already been invented by Baran
Baran uses words like ‘survivable’, ‘kill’, ‘salvos’, ‘target’
Davus reads Baran’s work, says, y’know, we don't need this in a civilian context

Lyndon Johnson in 1965 - directed agencies to support basic university research, and that centers of excellence should be created throughout the university 
Lawrence Roberts - manager, ARPANET project, 1966

March 20: Online Cultures of the 1970s & Early 1980s

The plot so far:
The emergence of personal computers
The emergence of BBS and other online services that are not the internet
Remember, the other kind of ‘computer’ most people would be familiar with would be the Atari video game console (and similar)
Playing games -> desire to connect -> WarGames -> regulatory climate
Playing games -> technological innovation

These early communities give people a sense of hot to be, via a computer
Because a lot of the early games were about recreating a sense of an actual place, my contention: these actually were places, for all intents and purposes
They were someplace you went. Your body might be here, but your mind & social world were elsewhere.

Where the people go, capitalism is sure to follow. It just depends on having the right metaphor

March 22: Sliding into hypertext and the Web

1983 - ARPANET switches over to TC/ICP; MILNET split off
1983 Domain Names System devised
1984 comes into effect: gov, .mil, .edu, .org, .net, and .com.
1986 NSF backbone is built; NSF, like DCA before it, limits use to ‘approved’ uses. Also decided to use TC/ICP
1987 over 10000 hosts now on ‘the internet’

1988 commercial email allowed to be transported over NSFNet - commercialization of that infrastructure begins
Senator AL Gore becomes interested in networks for research
1990 ARPANet shuts down
1991 Gore proposes, and sees it through, The High Performance COmputing Act. This is the ‘information superhighway’ financing bill, which amongst other things funds the team that builds the first Webrowser (Mosaic, 1993; evolves into Netscape)
1991 web comes into existence; 1993 explodes into popular imagination

First ‘viruses’ and ‘worms’ written mostly as experiments
Creeper - designed by Bob Thomas at BBN; it would copy itself onto connected computers. The first worm. 1971. ‘I’M THE CREEPER CATCH ME IF YOU CAN’
Reaper - designed by Ray Tomlison, to seek out and eliminate Creeper. 1972

ANIMAL - the first Trojan - 1975, by John Walker
ANIMAL was a 20-question style game, ‘What animal am I thinking of?’
Secret program included in it called PERVADE; when game ran, PERVADE would examine the system for directories available to the user, and then copy ANIMAL to those directories 

Once the genie is out of the bottle, lots of virus/worms/trojans emerge
Often the motivation is curiosity - who wouldn’t want to create artificial life, amirite?
But not always

BRAIN BOOT SECTOR VIRUS - first IBM PC virus -
Would essentially crash the machine during boot up

The story so far
The 1980s sees a growing awareness of ‘connected’ computing
Turning up in culture (eg WarGames; Terminator)
Commercialization of the government created infrastructure 
Internetworking of private networks into that infrastructure
Common carriage of traffic (what is later called net neutrality) a feature
AI Gore secures funding for another round of development, meant to expand access and foster more research

In computerized hypertext
Some act of selection enables you to pass to another level r another related concept
A formalization and action based on a relationship
The relationship itself has some capacity to act

A pattern language like:
How do we structure information and build relationships between pieces of data that help us see them across contexts, and clarify understanding?
How do we build systems that allow people to collaborate on shared documents without losing authorship? How do we credit and compensate authors based on their contributions?
How do we bring ideas and data from a variety of sources into conversation with our own, while leaving a clear trail back to the origin?

Nelson: “HTML is precisely what we were trying to PREVENT - ever-braking links, links going outward only, quotes you can’t follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management.”

“What we’re now seeing is the ad-hoc, decentralized manifestation of Xanadu in bits and pieces.
People are building Xanadu without knowing what Xanadu is.
Which is the essence of a good pattern language; true patterns evolve naturally within systems, and are found rather than crafted.” - Maggie Appleton

Microcosm
1986 BBC produces a new Domesday Brook - on laserdisc
Interactive explorations, with links & a pointer; demo from 1991
Inspiration for Wendy Hall, U Southampton

Intermedia - connected five different applications into a ‘scholar’s workstation Nicole Yankelovich, Nancy Garrett, Karen Caitlin; Apple nicks elements of the design
Sun Microsystems - Link Service, developed by Amy Pearl
Symbolics - Symbolics Document Examiner by Janet Walker

Xerox - Cathy Marshall, works on NoteCards, subsequently develops Aquanet and Viki - 1984
A very similar product becomes bundled with Apple in 1987, ‘HyperCard’, 1987
Ars Technica on HyperCard

Meanwhile, over in Europe
“HyperText is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will. It provides a single user-interface to large classes of information (reports, notes, data-bases, computer documentation and on-line help_. We propose a simple scheme incorporating servers already available at CERN… A program which provides access to the hypertext world we call a browser… “Tim Berners-Lee , R. Cailliau. 12 November 1990, CERN 

Hypermedia: constructive; to navigate it was to also forge the links that made things meaningful Web: passive; to navigate it is to go where the paths have been made for you.

March 27: Because it was the 90s

Excavating GeoCities
The ruins of GeoCities exist as a torrent from internet archive
Sites can be pulled from it; because of backwards compatibility, a lot of these sites can still work (for a given value of ‘work’)
The work of Ian Milligan

“GeoCitiessought to be a new kind of web place for its new arrivals: a place where you learned how to make a first website, with the possibility of friendly neighbors and helpful advice, and might even win a few blinking awards to help bolster your confidence. The web might have seemed infinitely big, but that did not mean you couldn't have a home there.” - Milligan

Homesteading as a metaphor embraces both of those tensions - homesteading creates a community where there was none before *if we accept the doctrine of terra nullius*; homesteading is a digital colonialism, and the eventual outcome of that is the strip mine, the clear cut

Community leaders emerge
“If that's the only reason you want to be a leader, think again. It’s hard work. Many of our leaders spend several hours each day answering questions and helping their neighbors set up their sites.”

“No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider,” (47 U.S.C. & 230(c)(1)). 
So section 230 applies regardless of how much content moderation gets done,but lots of people treat it as if it does

We are shortly going to be in a world where texts written by such techs pollute the infosphere.


On the next slide, enable Hypothes.is, and set your group to 'public'. Highlight the parts that are wrong, partially right, misleading, or true, with an annotation explaining what the problem is. Support your assertions/annotations with links to reliable data.


Respond to any annotations where you think there is room for dispute.


I will expect to see a note about this exercise (and last week's network analysis) in Memex 3.


Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) is an exception to certain provisions in the law, such as those prohibiting minors from accessing obscene material online or restricting access by adults to sexually explicit content. The CDA was passed into law on February 15th, 2006 and Section 230 became effective that same year. This provision of the Act has been highly controversial due in part to its vagueness; it is not clear what exactly constitutes “obscene” or “sexually explicit material.”
The Supreme Court ruled on a case involving this section of the CDA, Ashcroft v. ACLU, that Section 230 was constitutional and did not violate First Amendment rights as it only restricted access to certain materials deemed obscene by Congress or state legislatures; it didn’t ban any particular type of speech outright.


The CDA has been amended several times since its inception, most recently with the passage of The Protect Act (PROTECT) which further clarified what material is considered “obscene” and made sure that Section 230 was not being abused to access such materials by minors. This law also provided penalties for those who would try to circumvent these restrictions, making it clear that the government takes this provision of the CDA very seriously.


Section 230 has been a highly contested part of the Communications Decency Act since its inception and remains so today as people continue to debate what material is considered “obscene” or if minors should have access to such materials at all, let alone via circumvention tools like virtual private networks.
