### Summary & Key Take Aways
**

-   Galvani is famous for his experiments on frogs.
-   The investigation of electricity   
-   Laid the foundation of electricity research
-   electrophysiology 
-   This research led to eventual creation of the electric battery
-   Galvani concluded that there was intrinsic electricity in the frog
-   He prepared a frog with metallic hooks and exposed it to electricity. He did this first by using electric machines (Leyden jars, Franklin's magic squares). He eventually placed a frog on a railing that connected to a rod which was struck by lightning.
-   This created a physical reaction in the frog. (contractions)
-   Volta admired Galvani…    
-   Until his own research contradicted the findings of Galvani
-   Although Voltas experiments proved much Galvani’s wrong, he would have never make these new findings if it wasn’t for the groundwork done by Galvani 
-   Volta and Galvani continued to produce research that further extended the general knowledge of the subject.
-   With this, Volta created the first electrical battery.   
-   volta referred to the electrical battery as an ‘artificial electrical organ’
-   My interest in this article lies in the evolution of science, not in the science itself.
-   In a way, these experiments laid the groundwork for computers. 
-   Everything digital, began with electricity. 
-   The studies of Electricity kickstarter everything we see to be normal today.

### Links / Thoughts
Without ground work discoveries, evoultion could never take place. This is not lnly true in the context of this article, it is true everywhere. This is essentially the ground work for the internet. If electricity was never researched, then the internet wold never exist. 
- the evolution of the internet is a theory itself in this sense
