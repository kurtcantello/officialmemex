### Summary & Key Take Aways
**

-   Galvani is famous for his experiments on frogs.
-   The investigation of electricity   
-   Laid the foundation of electricity research
-   electrophysiology 
-   This research led to eventual creation of the electric battery
-   Galvani concluded that there was intrinsic electricity in the frog
-   He prepared a frog with metallic hooks and exposed it to electricity. He did this first by using electric machines (Leyden jars, Franklin's magic squares). He eventually placed a frog on a railing that connected to a rod which was struck by lightning.
-   This created a physical reaction in the frog. (contractions)
-   Volta admired Galvani…    
-   Until his own research contradicted the findings of Galvani
-   Although Voltas experiments proved much Galvani’s wrong, he would have never make these new findings if it wasn’t for the groundwork done by Galvani 
-   Volta and Galvani continued to produce research that further extended the general knowledge of the subject.
-   With this, Volta created the first electrical battery.   
-   volta referred to the electrical battery as an ‘artificial electrical organ’
-   My interest in this article lies in the evolution of science, not in the science itself.
-   In a way, these experiments laid the groundwork for computers. 
-   Everything digital, began with electricity. 
-   The studies of Electricity kickstarter everything we see to be normal today.

Without ground work discoveries, evoultion could never take place. This is not lnly true in the context of this article, it is true everywhere. This is essentially the ground work for the internet. If electricity was never researched, then the internet wold never exist. 
- the evolution of the internet is a theory itself in this sense

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   Telegraph offices in the early twentieth century employed both women and men as telegraph operators
-   This makes telegraphy an interesting case to study    
-   It was not common for men and women to work together
-   *links between gender and skill
-   The telegraph industry was based on the Morse electric telegraph
-   First successful use in 1843
-   “A wire linked two sets of instruments, forming an electrical circuit. One set of instruments might be in Montreal, the other in Winnipeg, linked by a wire string, pole by pole, across hundreds of miles”
-   Two parts
-   “Key”: hand operated lever that opened and closed the circuit. Send short bursts of current through the wire.    
-   “Sounder”: electrically operated lever that reacted from the currents sent by the “key”
-   Clicking noises were made that sent messages to the operator in morse code.
-   Gender stereotypes were very relevant in this time
-   Women were believed to have less stamina, lower wage entitlements, short working careers, short patience with the public…etc
-   In short, women were seen as less competent’
-   This industry involved branches where men and women might work together
-   For example, a press circuit 
-   Even with this evidence that women could do the same work as men, the meanings of gender at the time still prevailed.
-   Men still received higher wages and assumed superior status
-   Morse telegraphy eventually became “mens” work

 Even though women proved that they were capable of performing to the same standard as men, they were forced into the gender roles of the time.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   It is possible for information technologies to promote government transformation
-   Understood in 2 different ways:
-   As a transformation of internal processes    
-   As a transformation of the relationships between governments and other social and political actors (institutional transformation)
-   *theory of the co-evolution of technology, organizational networks, and institutional arrangements in the transformation of government.
-   What are the key variables and processes that facilitate government transformation through information technologies, such as government portals?
-   It is clear that the government portal is meant to satisfy the people (citizens,businesses, etc)
-   This guides the way government portals are transformed
**

### Links / Thoughts
The internet has become accepted by society. This is made clear as governments use portals in order to satisfy users/citizens. This relates to the Frankenstein article (source 5):
- people were not fond of the monster because the idea was new
- the internet was exactly the same. However over time it became accepted as the norm.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   The first internet was the global electric telegraph network established between 1835 and 1914.
-   The telegraph and the “victorian internet” have similarities’
-   Both operated by a series of codes relayed across interconnected networks
-   *Both brought lots of attention; hype. Skepticism, bewilderment….
-   The telegraph, and its evolution lead to the creation of the internet. The evolution of the telegraph had many different stages.
-   Did not jump form the first model of the telegraph to the internet
-   Governments were the first to support the creation of new communications systems
-   Telegraphy created a whole new world for business
-   Those who did not have access to the technology were at a clear disadvantage 
-   Most telegraph codes were created in the interest of the economy
-  the codes used to transmit messages were borrowed, adapted, or inspired by earlier forms of communication
-   Air and space travel would astonish Victorian time travelers, but not the internet.

### Links / Thoughts
 the telegraph had many different fazes in its upbringing which made it more and more advanced as it went along. With every shift brought more confusion and more excitement to society. 
 - this is exactly the same as the internet. With every advancement brings more confusuon, but yet more excitement and more widespread acceptance.

### Summary & Key Take Aways
**
-   Frankenstein represents a remarkable body of knowledge
-   By ignoring the human qualities that clearly make knowledge effective, particularly nurturing and caring.
-   Relevant to Galvani's experiment of electricity with the frog
-   Knowledge was a male artifact in the nineteenth-century
-   The monster, as the self conscious product of science, simply wants to change what counts as knowledge and in doing so, be counted.
-   If any constraints exist on Frankenstein's knowledge, they are social rather than supernatural. 
-   The monster represents a ‘species’ of knowledge that has not been contextualized
-   The monster was created out of the curiosity of the scientist, not for the good of society.
-   Because of this, society rejects the idea of it.

### Links / Thoughts
the monster represents the internet.
- because it is new, it is unaccepted by society
- however, it contains so much in whch the people could dicover.
