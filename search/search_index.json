This form of electrical science is Electrophysiology. Luigi Galvani and Marco Piccolino used their creations (Leyden jars, Franklin\u2019s magic squares) to send shocks through frogs. Galvani would stab metallic hooks through the frog, and expose it to electricity. This laid the foundation for electrical research. Without this research, the first internet would have never been created. The first internet in this case is the \u201cvictorian internet\u201d. This internet was not what we know the internet to be today, instead, it was the first ever telegraph. The needle lodestone telegraph, established in 1835 and 1914, operated by a series of codes relates across interconnected networks. This development removed the travel between communication. When you once had to travel by horseback to deliver a note, you could now send a message across the same distance using the telegraph. Governments were the first to support the creation of the new communication system, which was the beginning of government control over information. If this basic level of technology was never created, then relay and switching circuits could not exist. These circuits are the base of how literally all modern technology operates. A tv can not be turned on if the plug is not plugged in, a laptop can not connect to the internet if the wifi router is not plugged in, etc. Already, we can see how sending electric shocks through a frog, was the beginning of literally all modern technology. Eventually, as we know, the internet made massive advancements in a short period of time. Unsurprisingly, these advancements were quick to gain acceptance as they offered convenience. For example, as outlined by Tahir Qureshi, when online banking began in the 1990s it did not take long for people to see its utility. Beginning with businesses, eventually, everyone began to do their banking from the comfort of their home. Once the internet gained widespread acceptance, it did not take long for big industries to take advantage. With the internet, big data collection evolved alongside it. This data allows industries to target ads to incredibly specific groups of people. But there are also issues that come with big data collection. How much information should these industries really have about users of the internet?</p> <p>I did not feel like I got what I wanted out of this class. In the beginning I said that I wante to better understand where the real motivation came from that drove the development of the internet (who really served to benefit). I do not believe this was covered, or that much about the actual internet was covered in general. Yes, we learned about the electrical evolution, but the interent is a thing of it's own, and is far more complex than what we covered. In my opinion, the internet did not begin with the telegraph, it began with the first user on a web browser. This is what I was expecting to learn about. I would have liked to learn about how the internet went from the first web browser, to the dominant public sphere. Nowadays, the internet is where decisions are made that impact the direction of government and society. This is where my interest is. I also struggled greatly not because I wasn't following along with the content, but because the way this course was designed does not align with the university standard. It is not reasonable to expect students to learn all of these programs on top of compete the material. I am a tech savy person, and although I followed along with everything, I still had issues, and this impacts my grade. I understand that you wanted students to reach out, but I am a 3rd year student, this is an elective for me, and I work a fulltime job. I do not have the time to figure out all these little conjuctions. Grades should be based on content, and in the future, the details of this course should be outlined in it's description. It is not fair to expect students to either learn 5 new programs, or drop the class. Never have a taken a course that neglected all the basic foundations of all other university courses. Now, I am going to get a subpar grade on my transcript because I struggled to properly format my github website when submitting a normal essay with the same information would have achieved the exact same thing for you.</p> <p>SOURCE NOTES</p> <p>Title: two centuries after the foundation of electrophysiology, Trends in Neurosciences, type: Article</p>"},{"location":"#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>**</p> <p>Marco Piccolino, Luigi Galvani and animal electricity: two centuries after the foundation of electrophysiology, Trends in Neurosciences, Volume 20, Issue 10, 1997, Pages 443-448, ISSN 0166-2236, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0166-2236(97)01101-6.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223697011016)</p> <p>**</p>"},{"location":"#summary-key-take-aways","title":"Summary &amp; Key Take Aways","text":"<p>**</p> <ul> <li>Galvani is famous for his experiments on frogs.</li> <li>The investigation of electricity   </li> <li>Laid the foundation of electricity research</li> <li>electrophysiology\u00a0</li> <li>This research led to eventual creation of the electric battery</li> <li>Galvani concluded that there was intrinsic electricity in the frog</li> <li>He prepared a frog with metallic hooks and exposed it to electricity.

The CDA was passed into law on February 15th, 2006 and Section 230 became effective that same year. This provision of the Act has been highly controversial due in part to its vagueness; it is not clear what exactly constitutes \u201cobscene\u201d or \u201csexually explicit material.\u201d The Supreme Court ruled on a case involving this section of the CDA, Ashcroft v. ACLU, that Section 230 was constitutional and did not violate First Amendment rights as it only restricted access to certain materials deemed obscene by Congress or state legislatures; it didn\u2019t ban any particular type of speech outright.</p> <p>The CDA has been amended several times since its inception, most recently with the passage of The Protect Act (PROTECT) which further clarified what material is considered \u201cobscene\u201d and made sure that Section 230 was not being abused to access such materials by minors. This law also provided penalties for those who would try to circumvent these restrictions, making it clear that the government takes this provision of the CDA very seriously.</p> <p>Section 230 has been a highly contested part of the Communications Decency Act since its inception and remains so today as people continue to debate what material is considered \u201cobscene\u201d or if minors should have access to such materials at all, let alone via circumvention tools like virtual private networks.</p> <p>March 29: Dotcom Crash</p> <p>South Seas Bubble British gov\u2019t needed refinancing of its debt after various wars South seas company has a promised monopoly on trade (slaving) to South America What it actually has is an arrangement to buy gov\u2019t debt</p> <p>Get rich quick Shares rise from 124 pounds to over 1000 In 1720s value Price collapses by december 1720, ruining several fortunes Scandal bring first modern prime minister to power, Robert Walpole Beginning of regulation</p> <p>Lasting impact of the dot com boom The internetification of logistics Emergence of \u2018content\u2019 Development of advertising</p>"},{"location":"Features/LaTeX%20Math%20Support/","title":"LaTeX Math Support","text":"<p>LaTeX math is supported using MathJax.</p> <p>Inline math looks like \\(f(x) = x^2\\).
